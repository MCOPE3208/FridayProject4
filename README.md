Madlib Friday Project 1

Madlibs is a classic word game that invites participants to contribute words based on specific categories, such as nouns, adjectives, and verbs, without knowing the context of a pre-existing story. These words are then inserted into corresponding blanks within a predetermined template, resulting in a comical and often absurd narrative when read aloud. The Python code provided here emulates the Madlibs experience by utilizing the print function to display an initial instruction and the completed madlib story. The input function collects user responses for various story components, such as adjectives, nouns, and foods, storing them in designated variables. The final madlib template is constructed using these variables and formatted string literals, seamlessly incorporating the user's input into a cohesive and personalized story. This code not only captures the essence of the Madlibs game but also demonstrates how basic input and output functions can be harnessed to create an interactive and engaging storytelling experience in a programming context.

PowerBall Friday Project 2

The Python script serves as a lottery number generator application, allowing users to obtain a set of random numbers for a lottery game. The code utilizes the random module to generate either 5 main numbers between 1 and 69 or a combination of 5 main numbers and an additional Powerball number between 1 and 26, depending on the user's preference. The script begins by prompting the user with a question, asking whether they wish to include Powerball numbers in the generated set. The core logic is encapsulated in the generate_random_numbers function, which leverages list comprehension to create the random number set. The code then checks the user's input, generates the appropriate set of numbers, and prints the result. Clear comments in the code provide insights into each step, enhancing readability and making it accessible for users to understand and modify the script as needed.

Quizbowl Friday Project 3

The Python code provided implements an interactive Quizbowl Program using a dictionary to store questions and their correct answers. The program begins by welcoming the user and initializes a score variable to keep track of correct answers. It then iterates through each question in the dictionary, presenting them to the user one at a time. For each question, the user is prompted to input their answer. The program checks if the user's answer matches the correct answer stored in the dictionary, disregarding case differences. If the answer is correct, the user receives positive feedback, and the score is incremented. If incorrect, the correct answer is displayed. After the user responds to all the questions, the program provides a final score, indicating the number of correct answers out of the total questions. The code is designed to be easily customizable by updating the dictionary with additional questions, providing a flexible tool for interactive study sessions.
