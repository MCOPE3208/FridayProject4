Madlib Friday Project 1
Madlibs is an entertaining word game where players collaboratively create a story by providing words for specific categories such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and more. The provided words are then substituted into predetermined blanks within a pre-existing template, resulting in a humorous and often nonsensical narrative. The Python code presented here implements a simple text-based Madlibs game. It utilizes the print function to display instructions and the completed madlib story, while the input function gathers user responses for various story elements. The entered values are stored in variables and later incorporated into a formatted string, generating a personalized and whimsical story. This code showcases the interactive and creative nature of programming by engaging users in a playful exercise of word substitution, demonstrating how input and output functions can be leveraged to create an entertaining and user-driven experience.

PowerBall Friday Project 2
The Python script provided is a simple lottery number generator application. The code utilizes the random module to generate either a set of 5 random numbers between 1 and 69 or a combination of 5 main numbers and an additional Powerball number between 1 and 26, based on user preference. The script prompts the user with a question, asking whether they want Powerball numbers. The generate_random_numbers function encapsulates the logic for generating the random numbers, allowing for modular and easy-to-understand code. The user's input is processed to determine the type of numbers to generate, and the script then outputs the resulting random number set. In case the user opts not to include Powerball numbers, the script informs them accordingly. The code also includes error handling to address invalid user input, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Quizbowl Friday Project 3
The Python code provided implements an interactive Quizbowl Program using a dictionary to store questions and their correct answers. The program begins by welcoming the user and initializes a score variable to keep track of correct answers. It then iterates through each question in the dictionary, presenting them to the user one at a time. For each question, the user is prompted to input their answer. The program checks if the user's answer matches the correct answer stored in the dictionary, disregarding case differences. If the answer is correct, the user receives positive feedback, and the score is incremented. If incorrect, the correct answer is displayed. After the user responds to all the questions, the program provides a final score, indicating the number of correct answers out of the total questions. The code is designed to be easily customizable by updating the dictionary with additional questions, providing a flexible tool for interactive study sessions.
